Here, I append all the Code Solutions that I practise.
More often, the solutions tried by me, all the programs coded on my logic way through.
Here by, I am open for any suggestions and queries.
As a start through, I personally recommend any new beginner to start practising DSA with simple questions(However I disclose Q's in solutions or else link of problem) for impactful outcomes.


1: Printing Patterns (so here I have max possible pattern problem sol that can be asked in interviews)
